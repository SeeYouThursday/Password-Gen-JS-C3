# Password-Generator-JS-C3

## Description

This challenge site contains a random password generator which can be set to include five different parameters: password length (8-128 characters), including/excluding special characters, numeric characters, lowercase letters, and uppercase letters. The password length is set through a prompt, while the remaining parameters are set via confirms in JS. Through this challenge, I have learned how to set specific parameters, manipulate the DOM, and validate data through JS.

## Usage

Visit this URL to access this application: <https://seeyouthursday.github.io/Password-Generator-JS-C3/>

To utilize this random password generator, click the "Generate Password" button to begin. The password length prompt will display at the top of the screen. The user must enter a number between 8-128, otherwise, an alert will notify the user of the qualifications. Next, the browser will present several confirms asking the user, one by one, if the password should include special characters, numeric characters, lowercase letters, and/or uppercase letters. The password will then display in the text area with the current placeholder "Your Secure Password".
